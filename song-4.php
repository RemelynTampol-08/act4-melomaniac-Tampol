   echo "<p> There are times when I just want to feel your embrace </p>";
   echo "<p> In the cold night </p> <br>";

   echo "<p> I just cant believe that you are mine now </p>";

   echo "<p> I just cant compare you with anything in this world </p>";
   echo "<p> You're all I need to be with forevermore </p> <br>";

   echo "<p> All those years, I've longed to hold you in my arms </p>";
   echo "<p> I've been dreaming of you </p>";
   echo "<p> Every night, I've been watching all the stars that fall down </p>";
