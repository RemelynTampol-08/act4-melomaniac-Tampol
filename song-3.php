   echo "<p> I can think of all the times </p>";
   echo "<p> You told me not to touch the light </p>";
   echo "<p> I never thought that you would be the one </p>";
   echo "<p> I couldn't really justify </p>";
   echo "<p> How you even thought it could be right </p>";
   echo "<p> Cause everything we cherished is gone </p>";
   echo "<p> And in the end, can you tell me if </p>";
   echo "<p> It was worth the try, so I can decide </p> <br>";

   echo "<p> Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees </p>";
   echo "<p> And all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas </p>";
   echo "<p> And all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive </p> <br>";

   echo "<p> Try as hard as I might </p>";
   echo "<p> To flee the shadows of the night </p>";
   echo "<p> It haunts me and it makes me feel blue </p>";
   echo "<p> But how can I try to hide </p>";
   echo "<p> When every breath and every hour </p>";
   echo "<p> I still end up thinking of you? </p>";
   echo "<p> And in the end, everything we have makes it worth the fight </p>";
   echo "<p> So I will hold on for as long </p> <br>";

   echo "<p> As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees </p>";
   echo "<p> And all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas </p>";
   echo "<p> And all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive </p> <br>";

   echo "<p> I never thought that I would see the day </p>";
   echo "<p> That I'd decide if I should leave or stay </p>";
   echo "<p> But in the end what makes it worth the fights </p>";
   echo "<p> That no matter what happens we try to make it right </p> <br>";

   echo "<p> Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees </p>";
   echo "<p> And all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas </p>";
   echo "<p> And all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> Wounds of the past will eventually heal </p>";
   echo "<p> And all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> Cause all of this comes with a love that is real </p> <br>";

   echo "<p> I said all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> I said all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> I said all will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> All will be alright in time </p>";
   echo "<p> Oh, you never really love someone until </p>";
   echo "<p> You learn to forgive </p>";
   echo "<p> You learn to forgive </p>";
   echo "<p> Learn to forgive </center> </p>";
